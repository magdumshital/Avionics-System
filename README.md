## **Avionics System API Documentation**

### **Overview**
The Avionics API allows integration with an aircraftâ€™s Flight Management System (FMS) to access real-time flight data, manage navigation routes, monitor aircraft health, and communicate with ground control systems. This API is designed to interface with avionics systems, providing secure access to flight data and maintenance information.

### **Base URL**

      "longitude": -118.2437,
      "altitude": 36000
    },
    {
      "name": "WP2",
      "latitude": 36.1699,
      "longitude": -115.1398,
      "altitude": 34000
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **Use Case**
This endpoint can be used when an aircraft needs to adjust its flight route based on new air traffic control information or changes in weather conditions.

### **3. Aircraft Health Monitoring**
Retrieve the current health status of the aircraft's systems.

#### **Endpoint**
`GET /aircraft/{aircraft_id}/health`

#### **Description**
This endpoint provides data about the health and status of critical aircraft systems, such as engine performance, fuel levels, and avionics.

#### **Request Example**
```http
GET /aircraft/AC987/health
Authorization: API-Key {api_key}
```

#### **Response**
```json
{
  "aircraft_id": "AC987",
  "engines": [
    {
      "engine_id": "ENG1",
      "status": "normal",
      "temperature": 650,
      "rpm": 2200
    },
    {
      "engine_id": "ENG2",
      "status": "normal",
      "temperature": 655,
      "rpm": 2150
    }
  ],
  "fuel_level": 75,
  "hydraulic_system": "normal",
  "avionics_status": "normal",
  "timestamp": "2024-10-06T10:30:00Z"
}
```

#### **Use Case**
Maintenance teams or ground control can use this endpoint to monitor the health of critical aircraft systems in real time, providing early warnings of any potential failures.

---

### **4. Log Flight Data**
Submit detailed flight logs post-flight for storage and analysis.

#### **Endpoint**
`POST /flight/{flight_id}/log`

#### **Description**
This endpoint allows airlines or flight operators to upload post-flight logs, including takeoff, landing, fuel consumption, and engine performance data.

#### **Request**
